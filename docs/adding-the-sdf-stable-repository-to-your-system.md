## Adding the Bleeding Edge Testing Repository

If you would like to install our Release Candidates and/or track the Master branch, you can do so by using our `testing` repository. As the name indicates this repository and it's packages are not recommended for production deployments. Use at your own risk.

### Save the `testing` repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/SDF-testing.list:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/SDF.asc] https://apt.stellar.org $(lsb_release -cs) testing" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/SDF-testing.list
```

Please note we only support Ubuntu LTS releases.
